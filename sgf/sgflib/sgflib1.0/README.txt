Go Tools: Smart Game Format Parser Library
==========================================

Description
===========

For Python programmers, sgflib.py is a module containing a parser and classes
for SGF, the Smart Game Format. Also included is the module typelib.py, which
emulates Python built-in data types as classes.

Installation
============

Please note that sgflib.py and typelib.py are included as part of the
sgfsummary.py download, so you need not download them separately. Although these
modules are only useful to Python programmers, if you're not one, I encourage
you to take a look. Python is a cool programming language.

You'll need the Python language itself, freely available from
[[http://www.python.org]].

The sgflib.tgz (tarred, gzipped) archive contains the following:

- sgflib.py -- SGF Parser Library. Put this in a folder on Python's path.

- typelib.py -- Type Class Library. Put this in a folder on Python's path.

- README.txt -- Installation instructions (the file you're reading now).

- lgpl.txt -- The GNU Lesser General Public License; applies to sgflib.py.

I have only tested this code on my system, MacOS 8.6, running Python 1.5.2. I
did try to write it to be platform-independent. If you have any trouble running
it, find (fix?) any bugs, or add any features, please contact me.

MacOS users: please see the Macintosh Python Notes and the Macintosh SGF Notes
at [[http://gotools.sourceforge.net]].

To Do
=====

There's nothing on my list for sgflib.py right now.

typelib.py:

- Implement 'Function'? 'File'? (Have to come up with a good reason first ;-)

Have any suggestions? Want to help? Let me know!
